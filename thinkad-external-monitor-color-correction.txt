Try running the following command from a terminal while logged in:

xrandr --output HDMI1 --set "Broadcast RGB" "Full"
Your screen will probably flicker/turn off momentarily to apply the new settings.

If that fixes your problem, you can add this command to your ~/.xprofile file so that it runs whenever you log in to the graphical environment:

echo 'xrandr --output HDMI1 --set "Broadcast RGB" "Full"' >> ~/.xprofile
Hope that helps! It took me months to discover this fix!

///// worked
xrandr --output DP-2 --set "Broadcast RGB" "Full"
